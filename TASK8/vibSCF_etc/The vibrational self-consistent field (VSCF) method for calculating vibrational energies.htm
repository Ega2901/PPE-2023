<P>To calculate the vibrational spectrum of polyatomic molecules it is best to 
solve the nuclear motion Schrödinger equation exactly. This, however, is 
currently possible only for relatively small systems (4-6 atoms). For larger 
systems, to make the problem computationally tractable, approximations must be 
introduced. Such an approximation must reduce the numerical effort involved as 
well as retaining the important dynamical features of the problem. One of the 
most commonly used methods is based upon the vibrational self-consistent field 
(VSCF) approximation [<A

number of vibrational modes. The VSCF approximation is based upon the 
approximation that the wave function can be written as a Hartree product of 
one-dimensional functions,

approximation for the total energy is then given by

<P>The computational difficulty in solving VSCF equations is in evaluation of 
Eq. (<A 
href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~che194/research/rovib99/bk/node50.html#2ndeq"><IMG 
align=bottom alt=gif src=""></A>), the effective VSCF potential, which requires 
the evaluation of multidimensional integrals. Several approaches have been used 
to avoid this bottleneck, based upon expanding the potential function in powers 
of the normal modes [<A 
href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~che194/research/rovib99/bk/node51.html#joojcp105">3</A>] 
or only including interactions between pairs of normal modes in the potential 
expansion [<A 
href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~che194/research/rovib99/bk/node51.html#joojcp105">3</A>]. 
Monte Carlo integration of the multidimensional integrals was also proposed [<A 
href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~che194/research/rovib99/bk/node51.html#joojcp105">3</A>], 
but has not yet been applied to realistic molecular systems. 
<P>The VSCF method has been used for a variety of different polyatomics, all of 
which exploit its computational efficiency when applied to large systems. 
Examples include (Ar) <IMG align=middle alt=tex2html_wrap_inline4992 height=10

(recently up to <I>n</I> =8), peptide-water complexes [<A 
href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~che194/research/rovib99/bk/node51.html#grejpc101">5</A>] 
and glucose\ [<A 
href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~che194/research/rovib99/bk/node51.html#grejpcxxx">6</A>]. 
It has also been used for perhaps the largest system ever to have its 
vibrational spectrum calculated, the protein BPTI [<A 
href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~che194/research/rovib99/bk/node51.html#roisci268">7</A>, 
<A 
href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~che194/research/rovib99/bk/node51.html#roijpc101">8</A>]. 
This calculation included almost 200 hydration water molecules, giving a total 
of over 3500 interacting modes and showed that even for such a large system the 
spectrum remained assignable. 
<P>For systems where an analytical potential form is available, VSCF 
calculations are feasible even for systems having hundreds or thousands of 
coupled anharmonic modes. If such an analytical form is not available, a new 
potential function must be constructed. This approach, which requires a new 
potential to be constructed for each type of system studied, can become tedious 
and places as much emphasis on the construction of the potential as on the 
solution of the dynamical problem. These considerations led to the development 
of a new method, <EM>ab initio</EM> VSCF [<A 
href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~che194/research/rovib99/bk/node51.html#chajcpxxx">9</A>]. 
If Eqs.\ (<A 
href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~che194/research/rovib99/bk/node50.html#1steq"><IMG 
align=bottom alt=gif src=""></A>-<A 
href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~che194/research/rovib99/bk/node50.html#2ndeq"><IMG 
align=bottom alt=gif src=""></A>) are solved using grid-based methods\ [<A 
href="http://www.abdn.ac.uk/~che194/research/rovib99/bk/node51.html#joojcp105">3</A>], 
then the value of the potential energy function is only required at these 
discrete points. Therefore by interfacing an electronic structure code to the 
VSCF one, to compute the potential, the need for an analytical form for the 
potential is eliminated. This method opens the way for first-principles 
calculations of the vibrational spectroscopy of polyatomic molecules and, by 
comparing the results with experiment, provides a method for the calibration of 
the various electronic structure methods available today. <EM>Ab initio</EM> 
VSCF has so far been applied to several systems, (H <IMG align=middle

with promising results. 
<P>The VSCF method has proved itself to be a powerful tool for the 
interpretation and prediction of vibrational spectroscopy. The increasing 
amounts of computer power becoming available should make it feasible to perform 
VSCF calculations on even larger systems with even greater accuracy.
